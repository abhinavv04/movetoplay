movetoplay – Play Subway Surfers with Your Body! 
In this demo, you’ll see how I’ve used real-time pose detection to control the popular game Subway Surfers using body gestures alone — no keyboard or mouse required!

👋 Start Game – Join both hands to begin
⬅️➡️ Move Left/Right – Lean your body left or right
⬆️ Jump – Jump to avoid obstacles
⬇️ Crouch – Duck down to slide under barriers

The system uses a webcam and MediaPipe to track body landmarks and convert them into game actions using PyAutoGUI. This creates a fun, touchless way to interact with the game and showcases the power of gesture-based interfaces in gaming.
